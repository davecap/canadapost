## Example usage:

    import canadapost

    cpb = canadapost.CanadaPostBot()
    
    cpb.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)

    pdf = cpb.generate_waybill('CA',
        shipper_name='David Caplan',
        shipper_phone='5143122520',
        shipper_postal_code='H3N1V5',
        recipient_name='David Caplan',

        recipient_address_line2='#F31',
        recipient_city='Montreal',
        recipient_province='QC',
        recipient_postal_code='H3G1J4',
        # recipient_contact_email='dcaplan@gmail.com',

        parcel_length='1.0',
        parcel_width='1.0',
